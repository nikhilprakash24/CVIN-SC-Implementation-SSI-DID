/**
 * attackHarness.js
 *
 * Shared harness for the Thrust 5 security analysis of the CVIN vehicle-identity
 * standards. Mirrors the structure of scripts/benchmark_gas.js: instead of
 * recording the REAL gasUsed of a legitimate lifecycle operation, it EXECUTES a
 * concrete attack transaction against each standard's real contract on the
 * in-process Hardhat network and records the REAL observed outcome — never a
 * hard-coded verdict.
 *
 * Outcome model (one per (standard, attack) cell of the security matrix):
 *   "DEFENDED"   — the malicious transaction reverted (the contract's access
 *                  control / signature check / replay guard held).
 *   "VULNERABLE" — the malicious transaction was mined successfully (the attack
 *                  achieved its effect; a real finding to surface).
 *   "N/A"        — the attack is not applicable to this standard's identity
 *                  model (e.g. no gated issuance to bypass on a self-sovereign
 *                  registry, or no signed/relayed operation to replay).
 *
 * Differential rigor: most scenarios also run a CONTROL — the SAME operation
 * performed by the legitimately authorized party — and assert it SUCCEEDS. A
 * cell is only trustworthy as "DEFENDED" when (a) the attacker's call reverts
 * AND (b) the authorized call of the very same operation succeeds, proving the
 * revert is due to authorization/verification and not an unrelated malformed
 * call. Where relevant we also assert the protected state was not mutated.
 *
 * The accumulated matrix is written to
 *   ../../../4_comparison-framework/security-analysis/results/attack_results.json
 * by the after() hook in securityScenarios.test.js.
