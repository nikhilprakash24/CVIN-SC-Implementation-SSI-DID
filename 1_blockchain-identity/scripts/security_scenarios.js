/**
 * security_scenarios.js  —  Thrust 5 on-chain attack suite
 *
 * Executes real V2X attack scenarios against each of the 9 vehicle-identity
 * standard contracts on the in-process Hardhat network and records the REAL
 * outcome of every attempt (revert reason captured, state read back). No
 * outcome is invented: an attack is "DEFENDED" only if the malicious tx
 * actually reverted (reason string recorded) or the read-back proves the
 * property; "VULNERABLE" only if the malicious/undesirable action actually
 * succeeded on-chain.
 *
 * Threat categories exercised on-chain:
 *   - impersonation : non-owner create/mint/setAttribute/addClaim must revert;
 *                     forged issuer/UserOp signatures must be rejected.
 *   - replay        : replay of a signed meta-tx / UserOperation must fail
 *                     (nonce), or is recorded as unprotected where it succeeds.
 *   - identity_theft: transfer/theft model demonstrated (token-transferable vs
 *                     owner-authorised vs soulbound).
 *   - sybil         : can an unprivileged attacker create identities at will?
 *                     (gating demonstrated; cost proxy comes from the gas
 *                     benchmark, merged in Python).
 *   - recovery      : key-compromise recovery primitive demonstrated where it
 *                     exists (4337 guardian, 1155 issuer re-bind).
 *   - privacy       : read back on-chain state after a birth/registration op
 *                     and detect plaintext VIN vs hash/ciphertext.
 *
 * Output: ../../4_comparison-framework/security-analysis/results/onchain_security.json
